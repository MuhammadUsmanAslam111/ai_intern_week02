# AI Intern Week 02 – Titanic EDA

This repository contains my work for **Week 02** of the AI Internship. The focus is on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset.
## Contents
- `titanic_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all analysis, visualizations, and data cleaning steps.
- `plots/` – PNG plots generated during EDA (histogram, scatter plots, etc.).
## Key Insights from Data
1. Most passengers are aged 20–40; few children and elderly.
2. Females had a higher survival rate than males.
3. Higher fares are mostly paid by adults; children traveled in lower-class cabins.
4. Majority were in 3rd class; survival rate decreases with lower class.
5. Most passengers boarded from Southampton; survival varies slightly by port.
